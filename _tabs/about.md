Hey! I like to tinker with tech, figure out how things work (and how they break), and spend more time setting things up (and tearing them down) than I actually end up using them.

I'm a self-hoster/homelabber, always eager to try out a new project.

I spent 5+ years as a test engineer, then moved into a more technical role setting up and maintaining infrastructure.
For the past two years I've been in a Developer Platform team, in essence a DevOps role.

I'm passionate about helping people and making a positive difference.

Contrary to the avatar, I'm not a squid nor an octopus.
