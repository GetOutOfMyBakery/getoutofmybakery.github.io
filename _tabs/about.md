## About Me
Hey!

I like to tinker with tech, figure out how things work and how they break. I often spend more time setting things up, and tearing them down, than I actually end up using them, because I'm fascinated by the process and building my understanding.

I'm passionate about helping people, making a positive difference, and consistently learning and growing.

I've been using Linux in some form or another since around 2012.
I'm a self-hoster/homelabber, always eager to discover and try out a new project/services.

I studied English + Film & Media at University (2008-2012), then a few years later made the unexpected transition into tech.

I spent 5+ years as a test engineer, then moved into a more technical role setting up and maintaining infrastructure.
For the past few years I've been in a Developer Platform team, in essence a DevOps role.

Contrary to the avatar, I'm not a squid nor an octopus.

## About this Blog
A few years ago, when I was working with [Laurence](https://github.com/fuzzylogicxx), he shared his [blog](https://fuzzylogic.me/) with me. I really liked the idea but there were always other pressing things to do instead.

I've now finally decided to start my own as a way to share some thoughts, keep a track of some areas I find interesting, and generally to take some time to write.
