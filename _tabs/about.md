Hey!

I like to tinker with tech, figure out how things work and how they break. I often spend more time setting things up, and tearing them down, than I actually end up using them, because I'm fascinated by the process and building my understanding.

I'm passionate about helping people, making a positive difference, and consistently learning and growing.

I'm a self-hoster/homelabber, always eager to discover and try out a new project/services.

I spent 5+ years as a test engineer, then moved into a more technical role setting up and maintaining infrastructure.
For the past few years I've been in a Developer Platform team, in essence a DevOps role.

Contrary to the avatar, I'm not a squid nor an octopus.
